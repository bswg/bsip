## Welcome!

The Baskscatter Software Intercomparison Project (BSIP) is part of the [Backscatter Working Group](http://geohab.org/bswg/).

***

### Rationale

Although backscatter mosaics of the seafloor are now routinely produced from multibeam sonar data, 
significant differences have been observed in the products generated by different software 
when processing the same dataset. 
This represents a major limitation to a number of possible uses of backscatter mosaics, 
including quantitative analysis, monitoring seafloor change over time, 
and combining results from multiple data sources. 

A recently published study from the Backscatter Working Group: established under auspices 
of [GEOHAB](http://geohab.org/) and consisting of more than 300 researchers 
representing academia, governments and industry (Lurton et al., 2015) also highlighted this issue. 
The study recommended that *“to check the consistency of the processing results provided by 
various software suites, initiatives promoting comparative tests on common data sets should be encouraged […]*.

### History

With the aim of facilitating such a comparison, the BSIP was launched in May 2018. 
Software developers were invited to actively participate in BSIP and discuss how the inconsistencies 
might be overcome and, or at least made more transparent.
 
To date, the developers of four software packages (CARIS SIPS, MB Process, QPS FMGT, and Sonarscope) 
have actively collaborated on this project and other interested software vendors are encouraged 
to participate in this project.
